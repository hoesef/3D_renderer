# 3D renderer project design doccument
This project aims to implement a 3D renderer in c++ from scratch, with the ultimate aim of being able to render a screen reminissent of a Cornel Box. The program will render an image in .ppm format.

To help track the projects progression and stay motivated, bellow will list some goals and key milestones for this project.

## Project order
- [ ] Creating a basic PPM image (just a simple colour gradient)
- [ ] Implementing a frambuffer to easily create and modify an image
- [ ] Creating a basic line drawing function
- [ ] Parsing data from an obj file into an object class
- [ ] Producing a wire-frmae rendering of an object
- [ ] Rendering a solid object
